# Machine Learning in Finance

## Repository Contents
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model implementation  
- `reports/` – Supporting project documentation and written explanations (DOC)  
- `data/` – Financial datasets sourced from publicly available repositories (e.g., Kaggle, Yahoo Finance)

## Project Overview
This repository contains a **collaborative academic project** exploring the application of machine learning techniques in finance to identify patterns in market data, manage risk, and support data-driven investment decisions.

My primary contribution focused on the **Python implementation of machine learning models**, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and result interpretation.

The techniques applied in this project include:
- **LASSO regression** for feature selection and regularization  
- **Clustering methods (K-Means)** for identifying structure in financial return and volatility data  
- **Tree-based models** for non-linear pattern discovery  

These models were applied to financial datasets to support portfolio analysis and investment decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Implementing and evaluating machine learning models using Python  
- Feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and regularization techniques  
- Hyperparameter tuning and model performance evaluation  
- Interpreting machine learning outputs in a financial context
