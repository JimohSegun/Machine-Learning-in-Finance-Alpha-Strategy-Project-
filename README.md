# Machine Learning in Finance  

## Repository Contents
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and model implementation  
- `reports/` – Project notes and written explanations (PDF/DOC)  
- `data/` – Datasets used for the analysis (publicly available sources)  

## Project Overview
The project explores the use of machine learning techniques in finance to identify patterns, manage risk, and generate alpha signals.  
The models covered include:
- LASSO regression  
- Clustering methods (e.g., K-means)  
- Tree-based models  

These techniques are applied to financial datasets to support portfolio construction and investment decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction  
- Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation  
- Interpretation of machine learning outputs for financial decisions
